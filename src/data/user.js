	about: {
		title: "Weston Schutt",
		description1: "In July 2022 I had the honor of being a Taiwan Ministry of Education scholarship recipient and moved abroad to Taipei to study Mandarin for nine months. This afforded me the opportunity not only begin learning a new language and immerse myself in an amazing culture, but also to start my journey in software engineering using self-guided courses online. I will forever see that as one of the best experiences of my lifetime. ",
		description2: "I am a CX and payroll professional turned back-end engineer thanks to the Turing School of Software and Design. Curiously motivated to figure out how/why things work the way they do, I love creating the solutions that help customers and colleagues succeed. I am passionate about technologies intended to help small businesses and their employees thrive. I am known to be an ambitious individual who learns fast and strives for continuous improvement, while driving team development through training and mentoring.",
